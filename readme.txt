== Description ==

Push Monkey lets you send push notifications directly to your readersâ€™ desktops when new content is fresh from the oven.

= Why Push Monkey? =

= Increased Engagement =

Readers can be informed about your content at all times: when reading other websites or while working in other apps, with the browser closed. Even when the computer is not active - it displays all missed notifications the moment it wakes up. For Chrome, notifications can also include an image.

= Native outreach =

Your readers don't have to install any additional apps or plugins. They just accept receiving notifications from your website and presto!

= Granular Filtering =

Easily decide and control for what type of content to send out notifications. Filter by custom post type and by category for standard posts. No content clutter around here!

= Segmentation =

Define segments of interest for your subscribers. This will allow you to know what your subscribers are interested in and provide relevant notifications.

= Automatic =

By default, push notifications are sent automatically when you publish a new post. This workflow doesn't sound cool? No worries, we have a more granular filtering and custom push notifications.

= Statistics =

The plugin provides essential usage and engagement data available directly in your Wordpress dashboard so you can create the best experience for your subscribers.

= Visually branded for your needs =

Push Monkey is fully white-label. Your readers don't get to see any crazy bananas from us. Your logo, your text, your rules!

= Non-intrusive =

Push notifications reach a sweet balance between informative and non-intrusive. They appear above all other windows and if not clicked on, disappear after a few seconds.
  
= Super fast setup. Zero coding required =

Fast and easy to set up and no coding or API configuration required. The monkeys do all the pushing so you can focus on your content and readers.

= No Monkey Business =

Sending notifications on a big and reliable scale is not trivial, but our solid high-availability cloud back-end has already delivered millions of notifications...and it's not stopping here. 


**NOTE:**
Currently only Chrome 43 and above, Safari from OS X Mavericks (and newer) and Firefox 44 and above.

This plugin connects the WordPress API with the Push Monkey server (getpushmonkey.com) - server which actually delivers the notifications. An account on getpushmonkey.com is required. Don't worry, you can setup an account faster than you can say ba-na-na.
